# _CHANGED REPO NAME_:  Local Development Environment Configuration, Preferences, & Package Installation Bootstrapper 

### OS Agnostic (mostly) collection of dotfiles, shell scripts, configurations, & personal preferences gathered in ONE place, for backup purposes originally... now, trying to evolve it into something else, I guess.

================================================================================

#### by Brandon Leek (bleek42), with some help from forked repositories & code snippets from others (proper credits are a WIP)

#### Instructions
- Clone repository
- Move Linux OR Win32 directory contents, according to the operating system you are working on
- Pick & choose from the respective OS directory what you would like
- Move the corresponding contents to where they are needed into your local system (ex:  move .bash_* scripts into your users home directory, copy & paste windows terminal JSON file onto your own, import package list file with corresponding package manager command, etc.)
- EVENTUALLY: One will be able to simply run some sort of init shell script file in a POSIX/UNIX-like shell (such as BASH or ZSH, but probably not FISH, Powershell, NuShelll, etc.) IS A WIP....

 ======================================================================================

_That's all for now..._
