# [1.0.0](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/compare/@thi.ng/cache@0.2.40...@thi.ng/cache@1.0.0) (2019-01-21)

### Bug Fixes

* **cache:** TLRU: expected behavior on getSet() ([c3762e9](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/c3762e9))

### Build System

* update package build scripts & outputs, imports in ~50 packages ([b54b703](https://github.com/thi-ng/umbrella/commit/b54b703))

### BREAKING CHANGES

* enabled multi-outputs (ES6 modules, CJS, UMD)

- build scripts now first build ES6 modules in package root, then call
  `scripts/bundle-module` to build minified CJS & UMD bundles in `/lib`
- all imports MUST be updated to only refer to package level
  (not individual files anymore). tree shaking in user land will get rid of
  all unused imported symbols.
